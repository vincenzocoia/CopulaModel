## Installing the R package

:warning: These instructions have not been vetted yet :warning:. But, the hope is that installing `CopulaModel` is as simple as following these two steps:

1. Install `devtools` from CRAN by executing the command `install.packages("devtools")` in R.
2. Use `devtools` to install `CopulaModel` by executing the command `devtools::install_github("vincenzocoia/CopulaModel")`.
